* Game Class: This class is to contain the method main. This class will also keep
* track of the particulars of the game, such as the order of actions of the game
* (shuffling, dealing, discarding and determining the winner) and the evaluation of the
* hand (does the player have a Straight Flush, Four of a Kind, Full House, etc.).
* Actually it might be better to divide this into two classes: one to deal with the order of
* the actions and one to evaluate the hands.
